title: Hello world!
---

Typing `Hello world!` is a time-honored tradition in programming to get you started. It is your first intelligible sign of life to the world. A computational rite of passage. The prologue of a coming-of-age story. It's the first step to Lao-tzu's proverbial journey of a thousand miles.

Hello world once again (this time using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/)).

For those of you who don't know me: I'm Sebastian, German NLP student located in Dublin. Since I'm planning to stay here longer, I've decided to shift my blogging focus from traveling to tech, spiced obviously with a healthy portion of wanderlust. If you're interested, [my previous blog](http://rudersebastian.blogspot.ie/) can be found here.
